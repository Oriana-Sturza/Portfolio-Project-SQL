PROJECT OVERVIEW: a breakdown of what I achieved and discovered through this SQL analysis:


Data Exploration: I started by exploring the CovidDeaths$ dataset, focusing on countries where continent is not null. I ordered this data by Location and Date to get a general view of COVID-19 cases and deaths over time.

Death Percentage Analysis: I analyzed the likelihood of dying if contracting COVID-19 in countries with "states" in their name. This was done by calculating the death percentage (total_deaths/total_cases * 100) over time for these specific locations.

Population Infection Rate: I calculated what percentage of the population in each location had been infected with COVID-19 (total_cases/population * 100), providing insight into the spread of the virus relative to population size.

Highest Infection Rates: I identified countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population size, showcasing which areas were most impacted by COVID-19.

Countries with Highest Death Count: I identified countries with the highest total death counts per population, shedding light on the severity of COVID-19's impact in different regions.

Continental Analysis: I delved into continental data to identify which continents had the highest death counts, giving a broader perspective on COVID-19's toll across different parts of the world.

Global Numbers: I aggregated global COVID-19 statistics, including total cases, total deaths, and the death percentage globally over time, providing a comprehensive view of the pandemic's progression.

Vaccination Analysis: I integrated data from the CovidVaccinations$ dataset to analyze the rollout of vaccinations across different locations. Using window functions, I calculated rolling totals of new vaccinations and their percentage relative to the population, highlighting vaccination progress.

Temporary Table and View Creation: To streamline analysis and visualization, I utilized temporary tables and created a view (PercentPopulationVaccinated) that stores processed data for later use, facilitating easier and more efficient querying.

Problem-Solving Approach:

Structured Querying: I began by structuring queries to explore different aspects of the COVID-19 dataset, focusing on cases, deaths, infection rates, and vaccination progress.

Iterative Exploration: I iteratively refined queries to extract specific insights, such as identifying high-risk areas and tracking global trends.

Data Integration: By integrating data from both CovidDeaths$ and CovidVaccinations$, I was able to correlate COVID-19 impact with vaccination efforts, providing a more holistic view of the pandemic response.

Performance Optimization: I used techniques like window functions for efficient aggregation and temporary tables for temporary data storage, optimizing performance during complex analyses.

In my project, tackling complex query logic proved to be the most challenging aspect of SQL analysis. The task involved crafting SQL queries that went beyond simple data retrieval and aggregation from the CovidDeaths$ and CovidVaccinations$ datasets within the PortfolioProject database.
Initially, I structured queries to filter and order data from CovidDeaths$ where the continent field was not null, ensuring a foundational dataset to work with. This straightforward retrieval was essential for subsequent analyses.
As I delved deeper, complexities arose when calculating metrics such as death percentages (total_deaths/total_cases * 100) and infection rates relative to population size (total_cases/population * 100). These calculations required precise use of SQL functions and careful consideration of data accuracy and completeness.
Integrating vaccination data from CovidVaccinations$, I utilized advanced SQL techniques like window functions to compute rolling totals of new vaccinations and their percentages relative to population size. This involved partitioning and ordering data correctly to derive meaningful insights into vaccination progress over time and across different locations.
To streamline and optimize these analyses, I employed temporary tables and views (PercentPopulationVaccinated) to store and manipulate intermediate results efficiently. This approach not only enhanced performance but also facilitated easier querying and visualization of trends in COVID-19 data and vaccination efforts.
Mastering complex query logic was pivotal in extracting actionable insights from the data, requiring a blend of SQL proficiency, analytical thinking, and meticulous attention to detail to navigate through the intricacies of data aggregation, calculation, and integration across disparate datasets.
In conclusion, this SQL analysis allowed me to uncover patterns and trends in COVID-19 data, from infection rates to vaccination progress, across different geographic regions and time periods. It provided actionable insights that could inform public health strategies and further research efforts related to managing the pandemic.
